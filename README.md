# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](ama/)

I get a question by email. So I think it's better if I have a public AMA!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.


### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
